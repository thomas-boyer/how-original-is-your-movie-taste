<!-- This script was used to create a snapshot of the popularity and rating rankings on TMDB. It grabbed about 1/20th of the 19761 most popular movies and 1/20th of the 7101 top-rated movies in the database on April 10, 2019. The results can be found in popularity.txt and ratings.txt. Using these results, and evaluating them with my own perception and knowledge of movies, helped create my algorithm for determining the movie's unoriginality rating. However, this file has no functional relationship to the app. Note that the API appeared to return inconsistent results toward the bottom of both lists. As well, my app is skewed by the biases of TMDb's users as well as my own perception. -->
